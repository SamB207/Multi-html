        <p class="p"> I am a upper senior at Lehman college. Currently I am doing a major in CGI. <br>
            Personally I feel like is difficult being an enginer. There are a lot of thing to learn,<br> 
            which I am only familiar with HTML, CSS and a some Java. Because of my career I had to take two course of java coding,<br>
        where I learn some basic of java and a little to create an app. Still, I found it a little bit hard. <br>
        However, learning about programming feel exciting since it can help you to create a lot of things from the beging <br>
        and be as original as you can.
